 Regressions and Classifications.
Following ML algorithms are done by me : 

-----------------------------------
REGRESSIONS :
-----------------------------------
1)Linear Regression
2)Multiple Linear Regression
3)Polynomial Regression
4)Support Vector Regression
5)Decision Tree
6)Random Forest

------------------------------------
CLASSIFICATION :
------------------------------------
1)Logistic Regression
2)K Nearest Neighbours
3)Support Vector Machine
4)Naive Bayes
5)Decision tree Classification
6)Random Forest Classifcation

I have created a simple Template for both Regression and classification which I use.
Just by fitting the algorithm to the template we can predict the required outcomes.
Thank you!!!
